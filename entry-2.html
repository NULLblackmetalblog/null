<h1>Entry II — LUNAR AMULET - Yoke of Oblivion</h1>

<p>
</strong>LUNAR AMULET</strong>’s self-titled EP, released in December 2025, stands as a stark testament
to the atmospheric depths possible within black metal. Hailing from Portland, Maine,
Lunar Amulet is the solo project of Aaron Charles — known for his work in acts such
as Falls of Rauros, Rhûn and Blood Chariot — and this release sees him forging an
austere, elemental sound steeped in naturalism, mythic atmosphere and bleak urgency. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
</p>

<p>
Yoke of Oblivion exemplifies this approach: distant guitars and patient riffing
unfold with ritualistic weight, giving space to cold air and heavy silence rather
than polish or aggression. The track evokes a burden older than the soil and a
stillness that outlives those who bear it — an apt metaphor for the unforgiving
terrain that black metal’s rawest strains inhabit. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
</p>

<p>
This entry documents one such movement within the raw black metal continuum —
uncompromising, atmospheric, and unafraid of isolation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
